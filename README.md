## Purpose
Miski's purpose is to provide a stable, user-friendly ECS architecture for modern Javascript projects.

### Goals
* To provide good and predictable performance
* To provide a user-friendly API
* To provide a clean, readable, self-documenting, open-source codebase

### Not Goals
Because Miski is designed to be used inside other projects, we'll let those devs configure bundling and tune performance to suit their needs, therefore the following are not goals of this project:
* To be the fastest or smallest ECS on the web
* To provide polyfills, workarounds, or older browser support for modern ECMAScript features

## Features
* Simple, human-friendly API
* Modern ES2020 data-oriented Typescript codebase
* No dependencies
* Memory-friendly archetype-based ECS model
* Ability to use more than 32 components in one world using Uint32Array bitfields
* Fast, cache-friendly ArrayBuffer-based component data storage
* Define components and queries once, reuse them across multiple worlds
* `AND`,`OR`,`NOT` operators in Queries

## Install
The javascript module `miski.min.js` is found in the `./dist` folder, along with a sourcemap file and typescript definitions `.d.ts` file.

```javascript
import { createComponent, createQuery, createSystem, createWorld } from './miski.min.js';
```

See [API Reference](#api-reference) below for a complete list of named exports.

## API Reference
This is the complete API:

```typescript
üß© Components // (T: schema)
createComponent: <T extends Schema<T>>(spec: ComponentSpec<T>) => Component<T>;
  component.getInstance: (world: World) => ComponentInstance<T> | undefined;

üîé Queries
createQuery: (spec: QuerySpec) => Query;
  query.getResult: (world: World) => [Entity[], ComponentRecord];

üîÉ Systems
createSystem: <T, U>(system: System<T, U>) => (world: World) => (...args: U) => ReturnType<T>;

üåç World
createWorld: (spec: WorldSpec) => World;

  üëæ World Entity methods // ('Entity' is just a type alias for 'number')
  world.createEntity: () => number | undefined;
  world.destroyEntity: (entity: Entity) => boolean;
  world.hasEntity: (entity: number) => boolean;
  world.getEntityArchetype: (entity: number) => Archetype | undefined;
  world.entityHasComponent: <T>(entity: Entity, component: Component<T>) => boolean;

  üß© World Component methods
  world.addComponentToEntity: <T>(component: Component<T>, entity: number, props?: SchemaProps<T> | undefined) => boolean;
  world.removeComponentFromEntity: <T>(component: Component<T>, entity: number) => boolean;

  üîß World maintenance methods
  world.refreshWorld: () => void;
  world.version: string; // Miski build version
```

## Demos
See `./demo` for working examples.

## Benchmarks
Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

## Building
To build Miski from source, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

## To-Do
### Before Beta
1. Finalise API
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Ensure high-quality Typescript definitions throughout
4. Write consistent code documentation throughout
5. Validation for any user supplied arguments
### Before 1.0.0
1. Optimise performance
2. Consistent code style throughout
### Future
1. Allow for "changed" in queries
2. Allow for `onEnter` & `onLeave` events in archetypes
3. Serialisation
4. Multithreading support / playing nicely with WebWorkers / SharedArrayBuffers
5. Proper Deno support
